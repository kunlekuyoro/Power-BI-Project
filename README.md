## Summary

The project involves conducting business intelligence analysis for RKY Mega Stores' Liverpool division using order data from 2009-2012. 
Through pivot tables, lookup functions, and insights generation, I was able to address various causes related to product categories, regional sales, customer segments, and shipping methods. 
While the project offers practical application and skill enhancement opportunities, challenges include the limited time frame, data source constraints, and interpretation complexities.
Nonetheless, the analysis and recommendations have the potential to add value to RKY Mega Stores by informing decision-making and driving revenue growth.

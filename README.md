## Summary

The project involves conducting business intelligence analysis for RKY Mega Stores' Liverpool division using order data from 2009-2012. 
Through pivot tables, lookup functions, and insights generation, I was able to address various causes related to product categories, regional sales, customer segments, and shipping methods.
